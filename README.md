### Examining the geographical and taxonomic variation in the environmental impacts of invasive alien insects. 

All data and necessary R scripts to re-create the analyses and figures associated with this project are located in this repository. If so inclined, one could simply run the `1.run_analysis.R` script which will carry out all analyses and create all figures. At the beginning of each script, it is noted what data are required to carry out the analyses for that particular script. The lvl_0.RData come from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM) downloadable from https://gadm.org/data.html.

### Required R packages
The following R packages will need to be installed prior to running these analyses:
* tidyverse
